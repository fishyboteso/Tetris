This Addon allows you to play tetris while FishyBot is doing the heavy (fish) lifting for you.

### TODO:

- Better UI (show "game over" label,  Maybe add a preview of the next block, blink when fish is hooked)
- auto detect FishyCha / Chalutier / No engine integration
- Menu options to (1) blink when hooked, (2) to pause on Chalutier.looking
-  
- ~~Better UI (animation for deleting lines and game over~~ **DONE**, ~~fade out when hiding~~ **DONE**)
- ~~Ingame menu for pixelsize~~ **DONE**
- ~~Ingame menu button to temporarily show Tetris in order to relocate it~~ **DONE**
- ~~SavedVars for position and recovery of last game~~ **DONE**
- ~~Better show/hide options for when inactive (don't show in inventory and such)~~ **DONE**
- ~~Allow right/left-manipulation once after slamming~~ **DONE**

### Know Bugs:
- Chalutier states seem to break tetris' running state, especially fighting seems fishy  
-   
- ~~Spawning a new block is possible, even when a tower is in the way -> should be game over instead~~ **DONE**
- ~~Tetris continues playing when pressing slam, when it should be stopped~~ **DONE**
- ~~Improve randomness of block generation~~ **DONE**
