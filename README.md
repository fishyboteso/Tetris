This Addon allows you to play tetris while FishyBot is doing the heavy (fish) lifting for you.

### TODO:
- Better UI (show "game over" and "pause" label,  Maybe add a preview of the next block,)
- Try to add Votans Fisherman as engine
- improve simple engine to include blink and pause

### Know Bugs:
- Chalutier states seem to break tetris' running state, especially fighting seems fishy  

### DONE:
- Better UI (animation for deleting lines and game over , fade out when hiding ,  blink when fish is hooked)
- Menu options to (1) blink when hooked, (2) to pause on Chalutier.looking
- auto detect FishyCha / Chalutier / No engine integration
- Ingame menu for pixelsize
- Ingame menu button to temporarily show Tetris in order to relocate it
- SavedVars for position and recovery of last game
- Better show/hide options for when inactive (don't show in inventory and such)
- Allow right/left-manipulation once after slamming
- Spawning a new block is possible, even when a tower is in the way -> should be game over instead
- Tetris continues playing when pressing slam, when it should be stopped
- Improve randomness of block generation
